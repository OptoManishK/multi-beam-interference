# multi-beam-interference
### A Jupyter notebook for simple calculation of multiple beam interference profile where all the interfering beams are incident in an umbrella geometry!
### Fun example to try: Set no of beams as large number (e.g. 100) and see the results ....... you can recognize the resultant field pretty well ..... interesting right!
